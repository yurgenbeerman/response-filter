# response-filter
Launch this Spring Boot app.

Issue following requests:
http://localhost:8085/api/v2/api/transactions/,
http://localhost:8085/api/v2/api/transactions/lastload

The TransactionsFilter will add hash to responses generated by TransactionsController.

So the solution is to add TransactionsFilter.java to your Spring Boot app and register this filter in your @SpringBootApplication (see transactionsFilterRegistration() in my ResponseFilterApplication.java).
